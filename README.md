# Neural-Network-Implementation

In this project I have developed a three layer neural network for a three class classification, without using any GPU framework. In order to do so, I have based my model on the Computation Graph theory and I have made a class for each node type. The whole implementation of the project is explained in  "Report.pdf".

## Purpose of the project

The purpose of this project is to understand and master the theory behind the neural networks. Nowadays the GPU frameworks as Keras are widely used, and they are very efficient, but as an Artificial Intelligence student, it is very important for me to know the math behind such structures.

## Future Work

In future work, I would further develop the neural network in order to fit any number of hidden layers, any number of classes (binary classification too), different activation functions and different optimizators.
